**We're migrating the project from Google Code. The new default language will be English (Portuguese will still be available as an option).**

Why upSoonXML?
=============
You know when your webapp it's not ready yet, you have nothing to publish and all your users see when they go to your domain is a blank page with  a big `<h1>Coming Soon</h1>`. Argh! 

**upSoonXML is a PHP micro solution to solve this problem. Here are our principles**:

* Simple and minimalist
* Very useful
* Folderless
* SGBDless :P (there's no complicated Databases)
* Universal design
* Fun to use
